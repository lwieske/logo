The design is based on an Article by
[Mike Afford](https://www.mikeafford.com/blog/2012/05/golden-ratio-icloud-icon-revisited/)
and combines the themes cloud and digitalizations with inspiration.

The cloud fits in a box with width of &#x03d5; (golden ratio) and height of 1.

The two circles on the right side of the cloud have diameters
&#x03d5;/2 and 1/2.

And the two circles on the left side of the cloud have diameters
1/&#x03d5;&#x00B2; and 1/&#x03d5;.

The outer circles are located in the corners of the rectangle and the inner
circles touch the upper border; so only the x-coordinates of the centers of the
inner circles have to be given. They are at 1/2 and 1.

The yellow circle aligns a 45&#x2070; diagonal making it a lightbulb.

And the text - my initials ('0101'=5="L" / '1001'=9="W") - follows the biggest
circle with a distance.

The generate.sh script generates different icon sizes from the svg.
